Good question. It’s a climbing term that refers to the point where your rope or belay device connects to the anchor. It’s the critical point in the anchor system that bears all the climber’s weight, and is the thing that keeps climbers safe.

We named the company Masterpoint because we think that clean Infrastructure as Code (and code, in general) is the thing that makes it easy for a company to scale up technically, solve problems, and run efficiently, regardless of how many people are working in the business.
