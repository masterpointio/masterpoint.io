We’ve historically been an AWS consultancy, so we have tons of experience there. That said, we’re cloud agnostic when it comes to IaC delivery and will work with AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. We also work with any IaC workflow, regardless of if you’re automating GitHub, DataDog, DigitalOcean, or any other API Provider.
