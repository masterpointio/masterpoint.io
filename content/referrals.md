We love referrals! If you know someone who could benefit from Masterpoint's Infrastructure as Code expertise, let us know. To thank you, we have a referral bonus for leads that turn into paying clients.

## How It Works

If you introduce us to someone who becomes a Masterpoint client:

- You get **10% of the profits** from their first year with us.
- Referral bonuses are capped at **$5,000 per referral**.

**A Few Quick Rules:**

- Bonuses are paid once the client starts using our services and after their payments clear.
- Profits are calculated transparently based on Masterpoint's net earnings from the client.
- We will verify referrals to ensure fairness and legitimacy.
- We reserve the right to accept or decline any introductions based on fit and capacity.

## What Masterpoint Does Best

We help teams streamline and improve their platform operations through Infrastructure as Code (tools like OpenTofu and Terraform). Here's where we shine:

- Delivering battle hardened IaC workflows that reduce maintenance, improve operational efficiency, and keep platform uptime high.
- Helping clients avoid common maintenance pitfalls so they can keep a healthy ratio between platform engineers and application engineers.
- Helping teams scale their platforms smoothly while controlling costs, avoiding common pitfalls, and staying secure.

We only partner with teams when we're confident we can provide real value. If we can't help the team in question, we always aim to connect them with other great consulting organizations within our network.

## How to Make Introductions

Got someone in mind? Introduce your connection directly to [Matt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gowiem/) via email at [matt@masterpoint.io](mailto:matt@masterpoint.io)

When reaching out, we ask you use this email template as a starting point:

> **Subject:** Quick Intro to Masterpoint
>
> Hey [Referral's Name],
>
> I wanted to quickly introduce you to Matt at Masterpoint (https://masterpoint.io). Masterpoint specializes in Infrastructure as Code, helping teams efficiently operate and scale their platforms using tools like OpenTofu and Terraform. Given your role and team's needs, I believe you'll benefit from connecting with Matt and his team.
>
> I'll let you two take it from here!

It's entirely your call if you want to let the prospect know about the referral bonus. This comes out of Masterpoint's pocket and not the prospective client's, so we leave this to you.

**Thanks for thinking of Masterpoint and helping us find great orgs to work with!**
