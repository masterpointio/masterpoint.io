[Power Digital Marketing](https://powerdigital.com), a rapidly growing digital marketing agency, faced scalability challenges with their existing Terraform Cloud infrastructure. With a complex setup supporting numerous clients and a growing number of resources, they needed a far more stable, cost-effective solution. Masterpoint stepped in, leveraging their deep Terraform expertise to migrate Power Digital from Terraform Cloud to Spacelift, a more flexible and cost-effective platform. Through careful planning and execution, Masterpoint successfully migrated over 43,000 resources, optimized the infrastructure, and implemented automation to support Power Digital Marketingâ€™s future growth. 

> The result was a **10x reduction** in infrastructure costs, **significantly faster** plan and apply cycles, and a **more resilient**, scalable infrastructure that can easily onboard new clients
