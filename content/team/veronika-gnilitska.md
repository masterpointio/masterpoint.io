I’m currently based in Kyiv, navigating what we often refer to as “war-life balance”. In these challenging times, work and regular sports activities have become essential pillars of stability for me. I find solace in spending quality time with my family, close friends, and beloved pets - Fitz the cat and Icy the dog.

I’m deeply committed to supporting organizations that resonate with my values. This includes wildlife rehabilitation centers, such as the Ukrainian Bat Rehabilitation Center in Kharkiv, which has rescued over 25,500 bats and is the largest bat research facility in Eastern Europe. I also support various animal shelters and volunteer foundations dedicated to assisting Ukrainian warriors and medics, both on the battlefield and those who have transitioned to veteran status.

Since 2012, I’ve been a regular blood donor. Although health issues have recently put this on hold, I’m eager to resume this vital activity.

While travel isn’t a frequent part of my life these days, I’m incredibly excited about the upcoming Masterpoint offsite meeting this summer, as this will be the first time I meet my amazing team in person!
