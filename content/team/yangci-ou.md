Lately, I've been appreciating and learning to dance with what life brings and finding joy in the moment, particularly with life getting busier and busier. I also feel an extreme sense of gratefulness for where I am. Even with life getting busier, as I’m naturally curious and adventurous, I’ve been ambitious to want to learn more in technology & work (currently looking into more cloud certifications), as well as doing more things (activities, experiences, etc.) with friends and family in life, so I set a priority on managing my time efficiently.

Badminton, tennis, and pickleball are three main sports I play. I’ve played them for a while now and I’m still continuing to keep up. I’m constantly improving as I play more, but I don’t strive to be the best since to me, sports is not where I’m competitive in, so it serves as a way to hang out and have fun with friends and family, and it certainly has done that well.

I’ve also been trying to be hands on and self sufficient in all aspects of life, most notably recently I changed my car’s battery by myself. I’m not a car enthusiast or anything at all, I simply drive to get to where I need to be, so the only thing I know to do is oil changes. When my battery started to get weak during the winter, I watched some videos and decided to be hands on and replace it myself. It was really satisfying, not even necessary the cost saved or avoiding the hassle of a mechanic, but rather satisfying that I can solve problems self-sufficiently.
