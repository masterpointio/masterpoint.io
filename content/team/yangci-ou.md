Lately I’ve been learning to dance with what life brings. Staying present and finding joy in the moment, even as things get busier.

I’m also channeling my curiosity and adventurous streak into growth by diving deeper into technologies where it interests me most, while also making time for experiences with friends and family. I’m prioritizing better time management so I can keep doing both. Time management has become a big priority so I can keep growing without missing the moments that matter.

Along the way, I've been turning that curiosity into momentum by earning several certifications (and continuing to learn for more), including:

- [AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate](https://www.credly.com/badges/3b79670c-3091-4c52-b59a-6dd580c111b1/)
- [Microsoft Certified: Azure Developer Associate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/yangci/credentials/f18d5775bfc1d60)
- [Microsoft Certified: Azure AI Engineer Associate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/yangci/credentials/35524e81cbbc84a)
- [GitHub Advanced Security](https://www.credly.com/badges/472657ac-a234-4276-9c09-c0dc40262914/)

For fun, you’ll usually find me playing badminton, tennis, or pickleball. I love the casual, social side of sports and the chance to have a good time with the people around me is always a plus.

Outside of work, I’ve also been interested into being more hands-on and self-sufficient in everyday life. I’ve been treating practical things that pop up like mini-adventures, learning and troubleshooting as I go. Recently that’s looked like doing my own oil changes, replacing a car battery, installing a new ceiling fan, and working with sink plumbing. It's been great as I've found a lot of fulfillment in picking up a new skill each time.
