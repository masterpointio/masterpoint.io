This recent season of life has been about growth and transitions. Since starting at Masterpoint full-time in December, I’ve really enjoyed the transition to working on multiple client projects and moving quickly alongside the talented Masterpoint team. I feel like it’s a return to my small team/startup roots that I had as a new Ruby on Rails developer 10+ years ago. I appreciate how quickly we can move to start using Cursor, the AI vendors, and get company time to play around with agents frameworks & MCPs.

My wife is finishing up grad school to become a licensed personal therapist and graduates in August. We’ve enjoyed many dinner table conversations delving into counseling theories and practice, and my favorite topic by far is Internal Family Systems (IFS). Having learned over the last 3 years what it takes to hold space for others, I have more respect for those who professionally step into that role for others.

Outside of work, I try to keep up with a couple of fruit trees (apricot, peach, and plum), a strawberry patch, and a small garden I’m about to kick off. I love taking a break to check out the garden and see life teaming up all on its own. It’s refreshing in the midst of working on human derived systems & software to see a bunch of plants come alive all on their own.
