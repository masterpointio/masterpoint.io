The beginning months of 2025 have brought about a deep concern for me surrounding US' foreign and economic policy, so I've been working to devote time to figure out how I can show up as a friend, citizen, and business owner in what I see as troubling times. Specifically, with the invasion of Ukraine being an important cause that I'm dedicated to supporting, I am working to push more funds towards their defense effort and speak more openly about how to support them with family, friends, and on social media. I'd call this a work in progress, but it feels like a central idea that has shaped the chaotic months that have started the year.

For those that know me, climbing is a huge part of my life and this winter has been no different. I've been spending more time in the climbing gym as I've been working to train for the upcoming spring + summer climbing seasons. The spring has started to arrive and my weekends are packed full of days outside pushing myself physically on hard climbs. I'm oddly unfocused on what to climb right now as I have a simultaneous excitement for both crack climbing days in the Utah desert (6 hour drive) and clipping bolts on sport climbs in Boulder Canyon (10 minutes from my home). We'll see what wins out over the coming months!

A couple other recent personal developments:

1. I've started learning the drums and taking lessons. The drums are something I've loved and admired since I first got into punk + hardcore music at the age of 14, but I've always felt I wasn't musically talented. I'm working to shed that type of thinking, and the drums are something that I thoroughly enjoy. It has been a great process so far and I'm excited to see how it develops over the coming months + years!
2. I've happily accepted a position as a board member of a non-profit, the [Boulder Climbing Community (BCC)](https://www.boulderclimbers.org/). The BCC is the biggest local climbing organization in the US and they're responsible for climbing stewardship over a large portion of the Colorado front range. I'm stoked to have joined the board and be able to contribute to the organization in a more deep and fulfilling way as we work to preserve and celebrate climbing here in Colorado.
