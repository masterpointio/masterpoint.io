## Masterpoint's Recent Focus

We're actively investigating AI in the infrastructure and Infrastructure as Code space. We want to be on the forefront of this major technological shift and we're actively trying out new tools, techniques, and workflows. Alongside that, we're continuing to use our hard earned expertise to help our clients build better infrastructure with less effort.
