When working with [AWS IAM Identity Center](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/identity-center/) (formerly also known as AWS Single-Sign-on SSO), one of the most frustrating errors you can face is configuring trust policies that properly reference SSO role ARNs created by IAM Identity Center.

You set up a trust policy that looks correct, references the correct SSO role ARN, but still get an `AccessDenied` error.

It might be because of this critical gotcha edge case: region-specific paths in the SSO role ARNs.

I faced this issue myself, along with others on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73639007/allow-user-to-assume-an-iam-role-with-sso-login), [AWS re:Post](https://repost.aws/questions/QUpP-HDDmXT4C1YvjWvoVl_A/aws-identity-center-assumed-role-principals), and even [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/1ml4zjn/trusting_external_customers_aws_idenitity_center/). It's buried in the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/referencingpermissionsets.html) and easy to miss, so I'll cover it in this article to hopefully help others avoid scratching their heads for an hour like I did, and make it easily findable on the Internet.

## The Problem

You want to allow an AWS SSO role generated by a permission set to assume another IAM role.

An user from the AWS IAM Identity Center assumed into the AWS SSO role, and should be able to assume another IAM role, but they keep hitting this error:

`An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the AssumeRole operation: User: arn:aws:sts::123456789012:assumed-role/AWSReservedSSO_AWSAdministratorAccess_abc123def456/user@company.com is not authorized to perform: sts:AssumeRole on resource: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/target-role`

Your trust policy looks correct, it allows an user from the `123456789012` account and where their current role begins with `AWSReservedSSO_AWSAdministratorAccess` to `AssumeRole` into the target role that this trust policy is attached to:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Condition": {
        "ArnLike": {
          "aws:PrincipalArn": [
            "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/aws-reserved/sso.amazonaws.com/AWSReservedSSO_AWSAdministratorAccess*"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

But it still doesn't work. Why?

## The Regional Path Edge Case

This issue stems from a critical edge case: "when your identity source in IAM Identity Center is hosted in `us-east-1`, **there is no `aws-region` in the ARN**."

However, when the IAM Identity Center is provisioned _outside_ the AWS `us-east-1` region, **the service WILL include the region in the IAM role ARN**.

Here's the official AWS documentation that states this: [Referencing permission sets in resource policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/referencingpermissionsets.html).

**Expected role ARN pattern:**

`arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/aws-reserved/sso.amazonaws.com/AWSReservedSSO_RoleName_abc123`

**Actual role ARN in non-us-east-1 regions:**

`arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/aws-reserved/sso.amazonaws.com/AWS-REGION/AWSReservedSSO_RoleName_abc123`
`arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/aws-reserved/sso.amazonaws.com/us-west-2/AWSReservedSSO_RoleName_abc123`

Notice the `/us-west-2/` component that gets injected into the path.

## Diagnosing the Issue and Confirming the ARN

Let's run a series of commands to diagnose the issue and confirm the ARN. Once you're assumed into the SSO role:

### Step 1. Get Your Current Identity Information

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

This will return something like:

```json
{
  "UserId": "AROA3L3FW5XXXXXXXXXXX:yangci.ou@masterpoint.io",
  "Account": "111111111111",
  "Arn": "arn:aws:sts::111111111111:assumed-role/AWSReservedSSO_AWSAdministratorAccess_9999999999999999/yangci.ou@masterpoint.io"
}
```

### Step 2. Check the SSO role ARN

Extract just the role name from the ARN: `AWSReservedSSO_AWSAdministratorAccess_9999999999999999` (this will be different for everyone) and now you retrieve information about the role:

```bash
aws iam get-role --role-name AWSReservedSSO_AWSAdministratorAccess_9999999999999999
```

This reveals the critical information:

```json
{
    "Role": {
        "Path": "/aws-reserved/sso.amazonaws.com/",
        "RoleName": "AWSReservedSSO_AdministratorAccess_9999999999999999",
        "RoleId": "AROA3L3FW5XXXXXXXXXXX",
        "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/aws-reserved/sso.amazonaws.com/us-west-2/AWSReservedSSO_AdministratorAccess_9999999999999999", // Note the /us-west-2/ path here!
        ...
    }
}
```

Notice the `/us-west-2/` in the path! When AWS SSO is configured outside of `us-east-1`, the role path includes the region. This means your condition pattern needs to account for this regional component.

**Your assumed role ARN**: `arn:aws:sts::111111111111:assumed-role/AWSReservedSSO_AWSAdministratorAccess_9999999999999999/user`

**Actual IAM role ARN**: `arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/aws-reserved/sso.amazonaws.com/us-west-2/AWSReservedSSO_AWSAdministratorAccess_9999999999999999`

The trust policy pattern `arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/aws-reserved/sso.amazonaws.com/AWSReservedSSO_AWSAdministratorAccess*` doesn't match because it's missing the `/us-west-2/` region component.

## Why This Gotcha / Edge Case Exists

Unlike the AWS IAM service that handles IAM users, roles, policies, etc. which is global and region agnostic, IAM Identity Center is region-specific. AWS administrators has to provision the IAM Identity Center in a specified region, hence the regional path in the ARN.

As for why `us-east-1` doesn't have the regional path, it's likely because AWS considers it the default region and doesn't need to be specified and it's some legacy behavior when they first implemented it. There are other patterns like this, like even though AWS CloudFront is a "global" resource, it's still hosted in the `us-east-1` region. But, there's no documentation that explicitly states why this is, so this is an assumption.

## Final Example IAM Trust Policy

Here's an example IAM trust policy that allows SSO users from the Administrator permission set to assume the target role:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root" // We can use this to allow multiple accounts.
      },
      "Action": ["sts:AssumeRole", "sts:TagSession"],
      "Condition": {
        "ArnLike": {
          "aws:PrincipalArn": [
            // Instead of us-west-2, you can also use * to allow any region.
            // The wildcard (*) at the end of the ARN AWSReservedSSO_AWSAdministratorAccess* is also important, as there's no need to hardcode the randomly generated ID.
            "arn:aws:iam::*:role/aws-reserved/sso.amazonaws.com/us-west-2/AWSReservedSSO_AWSAdministratorAccess*"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

If you're using Terraform or OpenTofu, here's a `data` source example:

```hcl
data "aws_iam_policy_document" "assume_role_policy" {
  statement {
    effect = "Allow"

    principals {
      type        = "AWS"
      identifiers = ["arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root"] # We can use this to allow multiple accounts.
    }

    actions = [
      "sts:AssumeRole",
      "sts:TagSession"
    ]

    condition {
      test     = "ArnLike"
      variable = "aws:PrincipalArn"
      values = [
        # Instead of us-west-2, you can also use * to allow any region.
        # The wildcard (*) at the end of the ARN AWSReservedSSO_AWSAdministratorAccess* is also important,
        # as there's no need to hardcode the randomly generated ID.
        "arn:aws:iam::*:role/aws-reserved/sso.amazonaws.com/us-west-2/AWSReservedSSO_AWSAdministratorAccess*"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
