* **[Come Back Alive](https://savelife.in.ua/en/donate-en/#donate-army-card-monthly):** A reliable organization that provides medical care and defense analytics to the military and veterans in Ukraine.
* **[Hospitallers](https://www.hospitallers.life/needs-hospitallers):** A volunteer organization of paramedics that provides care and training to those on the front line of the conflict.
* **[UAnimals](https://uanimals.org/en/how-to-help/):** A humanitarian movement that helps animals within war zones by evacuating them and providing food and medicine for shelters.
* **[United24](https://u24.gov.ua/):** An initiative of President Zelenskyy that focuses on defense, removing mines, medical aid, and rebuilding Ukraine.
* **[Rely](https://rely.fund/en/):** A charitable organization established in late 2023, dedicated to supporting veterans of the Russian-Ukrainian war through medical treatment, rehabilitation, and prosthetics. The foundation collaborates with reputable partners such as NextStep Ukraine, Uber, and Revived Soldiers Ukraine.

We are proud to support these organizations, and we hope that you will consider donating to them as well to help Ukraine win this war. Together, we can make a difference and support those who have been affected by Russia's cruel invasion. Thank you for your support!
