"<strong>We rarely use outside vendors due to our high quality standards;</strong> however, our team decided to evaluate Masterpoint based on a recommendation from one of our executives. After a stringent vetting process, we engaged a lead technical architect from Masterpoint who came on board and provided considerable value to a critical part of our business within the first month of our engagement. <strong>We are delighted with Masterpointâ€™s performance over the past year</strong> and highly recommend their team to any company who can benefit from innovative / thoughtful technical solutions delivered in a disciplined manner with strong consultative leadership."
